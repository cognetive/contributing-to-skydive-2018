# contributing-to-skydive-2018

In this talk I share some insights gained during my first months of
contributing to the Skydive Project, the 100 commit mark was just an excuse ...

Some topics discussed:

- How one would begin to contribute?
- What workflow (typically) works best (Centralized vs. Push-Requests)?
- How are long running effort managed (hint: announced and broken-down)
- Using the Gits' ability to manage local history correctly
- How can you write code with more of an objective appeal/order
- *Does* open source software actually work for enterprises

I have made a conscious effort to veer away from domain specific / language
specific insights favoring insights with a general appeal which carry through
to most any other software development project.

The talk was given at IBM Haifa Research Lab on June 2018.
